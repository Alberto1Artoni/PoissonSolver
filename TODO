0. Add method to compute L2 norm
2. VTK visualization?
3. Implement lifting: this should help with CG? @@@ EXTRA POINTS!
4. Review how the linear problem is solved.
5. Add mesh refinement
    - add mesh visualizer
    - think to the algorithm: compare with the presentation
  

Final: improve comments
